# SAP ABAP Learning Notes 🧠

Welcome!

I created this repository as part of my personal learning journey while actively searching for new job opportunities in the SAP ABAP ecosystem. 🚀

Over the last few months, I revisited my old notes to keep my knowledge fresh and up to date. Then I thought — *why not share them with the community in a structured, readable, and helpful way?* 🤔

This repository currently includes two main topics:

1. **ABAP Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
2. **Core Data Services (CDS)** [Go Branch](https://github.com/CoderWho/SAP-ABAP/tree/Core-Data-Services-/-CDS-Turkish)

My goal is not just to share code snippets, but also to explain the logic behind each concept step by step — to help you truly understand how things work.

## 🔗 Repository Purpose

- For beginners trying to grasp SAP ABAP basics 👶  
- For developers refreshing their knowledge 💡  
- For anyone interested in SAP’s data modeling and object-oriented programming features 🎯
